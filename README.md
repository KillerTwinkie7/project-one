# project-one
A shared repo for project 1.

If you're downloading this to work on your part of the project, all you should need to do is move the CSV file of the data you downloaded into the 'data' folder, and rename it 'crime_data'. GitHub wouldn't allow me to upload anything bigger than 25 Mb, so you'll need to provide your own CSV for it.

Other than that though, there shouldn't be any issues reading the file in. I wrote this little block of code to automatically get the directory, so hopefully that alleviates some headaches.
